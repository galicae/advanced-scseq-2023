# advanced-scseq-2023

This repository was originally intended to hold the material for the course "2023S 300164-1 Advanced
bioinformatic analysis of single-cell data" in the summer semester of 2023 at the University of
Vienna. Over time, I intend to keep evolving this document and the material in the course to
reflect the change in the students' background and the needs of the department.
